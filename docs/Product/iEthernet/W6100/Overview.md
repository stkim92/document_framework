## Overview

![](/products/w6100/w6100_4.jpg)
**Hardwired Dual TCP/IP Stack Controller**

W6100 is a hardwired Internet controller chip supporting IPv4/IPv6 dual
stack by adding IPv6 functions on the basis of WIZnetâ€™s patented
hardwired TCP/IP core technology. W6100 supports TCP/IP protocols such
as TCP, UDP, IPv6, IPv4, ICMPv6, ICMPv4, IGMP, ARP and PPPoE. W6100 also
includes 10Base-T / 10Base-Te / 100Base-TX Ethernet PHY and Ethernet MAC
Controller which makes it suitable for embedded internet-enabled
devices.

W6100 has 8 independent hardwired SOCKETs and supports various
SOCKET-less commands, which are for IPv6 auto-configuration, monitoring,
and managing the network via ARP, PINGv4, and PINGv6.

W6100 supports two kinds of HOST interfaces; SPI and parallel system
BUS. It has 32KB internal memory for sending and receiving data.
Designed for low power and low heat, W6100 provides WOL (Wake On LAN),
Ethernet PHY power down mode and etc. W6100 has two package types, 48
LQFP and 48 QFN lead-free. Both versions are PIN-2-PIN compatible with
W5100S.
