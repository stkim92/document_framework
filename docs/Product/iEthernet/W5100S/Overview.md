# W5100S

## Overview

![](/products/w5100s/w5100s_pm.png)

W5100S is an embedded Internet controller designed as a full hardwired
TCP/IP with WIZnet technology. W5100S provides internet connectivity to
your embedded system by using SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or
Parallel System BUS. SPI and Parallel System BUS provide easy connection
via external MCU to W5100S. The clock speed of W5100S SPI supports upto
70MHz and the Parallel System Bus supports higher speed network
communication than SPI.

Since W5100S integrates the Hardwired TCP/IP stack with 10/100 Ethernet
MAC and PHY, it is truly a one-chip solution for the stable internet
connectivity. WIZnetâ€™s hardwired TCP/IP stack supports TCP, UDP, IPv4,
ICMP, ARP, IGMP, and PPPoE - and it has been proven through various
applications over the last decade.

W5100S provides four independent SOCKETs to be used simultaneously and
16KB internal memory for data communication. Users can develop an
Ethernet application easily by using the simple W5100S SOCKET program
instead of handling a complex Ethernet controller. W5100S also provides
WOL (Wake on LAN) and a Power Down Mode in order to reduce power
consumption.

W5100S is a low-cost chip that exceeds its predecessor, W5100. Existing
firmware using W5100 can be used on W5100S without modification. W5100S
has two types of packages, 48 Pin LQFP & QFN Lead-Free Package.
