### AP Mode using WPA2 Static IP

This section explains how to set AP mode using WizFi250. In AP mode, WizFi250 have to set static IP address. (AT+WNET=0,xxx,xxx,xxx) After setting AP mode, WizFi250 will operate DHCP Server. Thus, when smart phone or other devices connect to WizFi250, WizFi250 will give IP address to connected device.
