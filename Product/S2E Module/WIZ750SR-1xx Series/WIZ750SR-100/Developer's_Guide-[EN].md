## WIZ750SR Recovery User Guide

### Overview

The full firmware source code of the WIZ750SR product is available at
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZ750SR), and it uses
the [Apache
License 2.0](https://github.com/Wiznet/WIZ750SR/blob/master/LICENSE),
anyone can freely modify(called 'customize') and distribute it without
restriction. These documents describe how to restore the product through
the firmware update if the product does not work during the user's
customization.

If the user wants to customize the application area only and keep using
the configuration tool functions of the WIZ750SR product(Device Search /
Setting / Update and Etc.), Users can use the 'Network Firmware Update'
function of the configuration tool to update the modified application to
the WIZ750SR and check if it works well. At this time, if there is a
problem in the operation of the customized application firmware and the
search function does not work, **AppBoot mode** can be used for search
and recovery the device.

If you want to customize the entire firmware while maintaining the
WIZ750SR's hardware, you can update the full binary directly to the code
flash memory by using the **W7500x ISP Tool(WIZISP)** of the W7500 /
W7500P chip using a serial port. The WIZ750SR-EVB is equipped with a
switch(BOOT) for accessing the MCU boot mode. It can perform ISP
(In-System Programming) operation through Debug UART (Micro USB
connector) located on the EVB side.
