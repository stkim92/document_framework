## Overview

**W5500 IPRAW mode** can handle IP layer's upper protocol
in the TCP/IP Layer. W5500 IPRAW mode supports transport layer protocol
such as
\[ICMP\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol>)(0x01),\[IGMP\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol>)(0x02),\[TCP\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>)
(0x06) and
\[UDP\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol>)(0x11)
according to the protocol field of IP header, depending on the protocol
number. The 'Ping' of ICMP is already implemented in W5500 as the
Hardwired but when the user needs, the host can directly process the
ICMP function include ping by opening the Socket n as an IPRAW mode.
